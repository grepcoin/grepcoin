## One-Liner

GrepCoin is an open-source crypto arcade with 8 play-to-earn games, built entirely through human-AI collaboration.

---

## Short Description (50 words)

GrepCoin is the first crypto gaming platform built entirely with AI collaboration. Featuring 8 developer-themed arcade games on Base L2, players can earn GREP tokens through skill-based gameplay. With production-ready smart contracts, a 5-tier staking system, and MIT-licensed open-source code, GrepCoin proves what's possible when human creativity meets AI capability.

---

## Medium Description (150 words)

GrepCoin represents a new paradigm in software development: an entire crypto gaming platform built through intensive human-AI collaboration between a solo founder and Claude (Anthropic's AI). What would traditionally require a team of developers and months of work was accomplished in days.

The platform features 8 unique arcade games with developer-themed mechanics: from Grep Rails (regex pattern matching) to Stack Panic (function stack management) to Bug Hunter (code debugging). Players earn GREP tokens based on skill, not investment, with a sustainable tokenomics model funded by real revenue from cosmetics and tournaments.

Built on Base L2 (Coinbase's Ethereum layer 2), GrepCoin offers low fees and fast transactions. The 5-tier staking system provides up to 2x multipliers for committed players. All code is MIT licensed and open source on GitHub.

GrepCoin is for indie developers, hobbyists, and gamers who believe crypto should be fun first.

## Long Description (300 words)

GrepCoin is proof that the future of software development isn't about replacing developers—it's about amplifying what a single person with a vision can accomplish.

Created through an unprecedented partnership between a solo founder and Claude (Anthropic's AI), every line of GrepCoin's code—from Solidity smart contracts to React components to Prisma database schemas—was crafted through human-AI collaboration. The result: a production-ready crypto gaming platform built in days, not months.

The platform features 8 developer-themed arcade games, each with unique mechanics that resonate with the indie dev community. Grep Rails challenges players to build train tracks by matching regex patterns. Stack Panic requires clearing function calls before they overflow. Bug Hunter rewards finding and squashing bugs in scrolling code. Each game demonstrates that play-to-earn can prioritize fun over finance.

GrepCoin's tokenomics are designed for sustainability, not speculation. Unlike projects that rely on new player investment to pay existing players (the "Ponzi" model that killed Axie Infinity), GrepCoin generates revenue through optional cosmetics, tournament entry fees, and premium features. This real revenue funds player rewards, creating a sustainable economic loop.

Built on Base L2, Coinbase's Ethereum layer 2 network, GrepCoin offers the security of Ethereum with fees under $0.01 and near-instant transactions. The 5-tier staking system (Flexible through Diamond) provides multipliers from 1.1x to 2x for players who commit their tokens.

Most importantly, GrepCoin is 100% open source under the MIT license. Anyone can fork, modify, and improve the codebase. This isn't a closed corporate project—it's a community platform built in public.

GrepCoin is operated by GrepLabs LLC, a Delaware company built in California. The project is currently fundraising on Indiegogo to fund security audits, initial liquidity, and mainnet deployment.
