## Slide 1: Title

**GrepCoin**
*The AI-Built Crypto Arcade*

Play. Earn. Own.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Crypto Gaming is Broken

- **Pay-to-Win:** $500+ NFTs required to start
- **Ponzi Economics:** Need new players to pay existing players
- **Boring Games:** Finance first, fun second
- **Closed Source:** No transparency, no ownership

*$269M lost to smart contract exploits in 2024 alone*

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

### GrepCoin: Gaming for Everyone

- **Free to Play:** No wallet needed to start
- **Skill-Based Rewards:** Earn based on performance, not investment

## Slide 4: The Innovation

### Built Entirely with AI

GrepCoin was created through human-AI collaboration between a solo founder and Claude (Anthropic's AI).

**What would take a team months, we built in days:**

- 8 fully playable games
- Production-ready smart contracts
- Complete web application
- 47 passing tests
