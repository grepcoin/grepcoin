# GrepCoin (GREP) Tokenomics

## The AI Evolution Economy

GrepCoin introduces a **deflationary utility model** where platform growth drives token scarcity. Every AI-generated game, level, and content piece burns GREP tokens.

**Core Principle:** *The more the platform evolves, the scarcer GREP becomes.*

## The Burn Economy

### What Gets Burned

| Category | Action | Burn Amount |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **AI Evolution** | New game generation | 50,000 GREP |
| **AI Evolution** | Seasonal content | 25,000 GREP |
| **AI Evolution** | Weekly challenges | 5,000 GREP |
| **Governance** | Evolution vote | All voted GREP |
| **Marketplace** | Sale fee | 2.5% of sale |
| **Tournaments** | Entry fee | 10% of entry |
| **Achievements** | Mint badge | 10 GREP |
| **Guilds** | Create guild | 500 GREP |
| **Custom** | Request AI challenge | 100 GREP |

### Burn Targets

| Year | Target Burn | Circulating After |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 15M (3%) | ~200M |
| 3 | 35M total (7%) | ~165M |
| 5 | 75M total (15%) | ~125M |
| 10 | 150M total (30%) | ~100M |

**Long-term goal:** Reduce circulating supply to 100M (80% total burn)

---

## Weekly Evolution Auctions

Every week, the community votes on what AI builds next:

```
Monday    → Proposals open (100 GREP to propose)
Wednesday → Voting begins (vote with GREP)
Friday    → Winner announced
Weekend   → AI generates content
Monday    → New content released
```

**Key mechanic:** All voted GREP is burned, not returned.

This creates:
- Constant burn pressure
- Community engagement
- Player-driven content
- Weekly scarcity events

---

## Staking: Real Yield Model

### Revenue-Based Rewards

Staking APY comes from **platform revenue**, not token emissions:

| Revenue Source | % to Stakers |
|----------------|--------------|
| Marketplace fees | 50% |
| Tournament fees | 50% |
| Premium subscriptions | 30% |
| Partnership revenue | 20% |

### Staking Tiers

| Tier | Minimum | Lock | APY* | Perks |
|------|---------|------|------|-------|
| Basic | 100 GREP | None | 3% | Vote on evolutions |
| Silver | 1,000 GREP | 7 days | 5% | Early access to content |
| Gold | 5,000 GREP | 30 days | 6% | Propose evolutions |
| Diamond | 25,000 GREP | 90 days | 8% | Revenue share + governance |

*APY varies based on platform revenue and total staked

```
More Players → More Activity → More Burns + Revenue
      ↓                              ↓
Higher Staking Yield ← Scarcer Token ← Token Value Up
      ↓
More Attractive to New Players → [Loop]
```

| Max Wallet | 2% of supply (10M GREP) |
| Max Transaction | 0.5% of supply (2.5M GREP) |
| Whale Alerts | Notify on transfers > 1M GREP |
| Multi-sig Treasury | 3/5 signers required |

---

## Governance

## Key Metrics & Targets

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Tokens Burned | 15M | 50M |
| Circulating Supply | 200M | 150M |
| Active Stakers | 5,000 | 50,000 |
| Platform Revenue | $50K/mo | $500K/mo |
| Staking APY | 3-5% | 5-8% |

---

## Why This Model Works

| Traditional P2E | GrepCoin |
|-----------------|----------|
| Infinite emissions | Fixed supply + burns |
| APY from printing | APY from revenue |
| Token dumps on gains | Token burned on use |
| Death spiral risk | Deflationary spiral |
| Speculation-driven | Utility-driven |

---

## Summary

GrepCoin's AI Evolution Economy creates a **sustainable, deflationary token** where:

1. **Supply decreases** as platform grows
2. **AI content** drives burns and engagement
3. **Real revenue** funds staking rewards
4. **Community votes** shape the future
5. **Scarcity increases** over time

**This is not play-to-earn. This is own-to-participate.**
