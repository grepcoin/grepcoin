## Deflationary Mechanics

### Transaction Fee Burn

### Buyback Program
- 10% of platform revenue used for open market buybacks
- Purchased tokens added to staking rewards or burned
- Executed quarterly, transparent on-chain

### Staking Locks
- Staked tokens removed from circulating supply
- Tiered lock periods: 30 / 90 / 180 / 365 days
- Longer locks earn higher rewards

---

## Economic Sustainability

### Revenue Sources
1. Marketplace fees (2.5% per transaction)
2. Project listing fees
3. Premium features and subscriptions
4. Partnership integrations

### Treasury Management

---

## Anti-Manipulation Safeguards

- **Max Wallet**: 2% of supply (10M GREP) for non-contract addresses
- **Max Transaction**: 0.5% of supply (2.5M GREP) per transaction
- **Anti-Bot**: Launch with trading delay and gas limits
- **Whale Alerts**: Public notifications for transfers > 1M GREP
