This disclaimer supplements our Terms of Service and should be read in conjunction with them.

---

## 1. No Financial Advice

Nothing on the GrepCoin website (grepcoin.io), in our documentation, whitepaper, social media channels, or communicated by GrepLabs LLC, its officers, directors, employees, contractors, or representatives constitutes:

- Financial advice
- Investment advice
- Trading advice
- Legal advice
- Tax advice
- Accounting advice

**The information provided is for general informational and entertainment purposes only.**

## 2. GREP Token Risks

### 2.1 Not an Investment

**GREP is a utility token designed exclusively for use within the GrepCoin gaming ecosystem.**

GREP is **NOT**:

- An investment vehicle
- A security or financial instrument
- A share, equity, or ownership interest in GrepLabs LLC or any entity
- A claim to future profits, dividends, revenue, or returns
- Legal tender or a substitute for fiat currency
- A commodity or store of value
- Subject to any buyback, redemption, or guaranteed value program

**Do not acquire GREP with any expectation of profit or financial return. GREP should only be acquired for its intended utility within the platform.**

### 2.2 Price Volatility

The value of GREP, like all cryptocurrencies and tokens, is **highly volatile** and may fluctuate significantly due to:

- Market supply and demand
- Speculation and trading activity
- Technological changes
- Regulatory developments
- Competition from other projects
- Market sentiment and perception
- Macroeconomic conditions
- Liquidity constraints

**The value of GREP may decrease substantially or become worthless.** You should only use funds that you can afford to lose entirely without impacting your financial well-being.

### 2.3 No Guarantees or Promises

We make **NO** guarantees or promises regarding:

- The future value of GREP tokens
- The continued utility or functionality of GREP
- The continued availability or operation of the platform
- The liquidity of GREP (ability to sell or exchange)
- The existence of markets or exchanges for GREP
- The maintenance or development of the project
- Achievement of roadmap goals or milestones

The token may:

- Lose all value and become worthless
- Become illiquid with no buyers
- Be delisted from exchanges (if listed)
- Cease to function if the platform shuts down
- Be affected by smart contract vulnerabilities

### 2.4 Not a Security

GREP is structured and intended to be a utility token, not a security. However:

- We make no legal representations about the classification of GREP under securities laws
- Regulatory authorities may take different views on token classifications
- Laws may change, affecting how GREP is classified
- You are responsible for understanding how GREP is treated in your jurisdiction

**GREP does not entitle holders to:**

- Voting rights in GrepLabs LLC
- Dividends, profit sharing, or revenue distribution
- Ownership or equity in the company
- Any claims on company assets
- Governance rights over the company (though on-chain governance may exist)

### 2.5 Loss of Value

**YOU MAY LOSE ALL FUNDS INVESTED IN OR USED TO ACQUIRE GREP TOKENS.**

Factors that could lead to total loss include:

- Smart contract vulnerabilities or exploits
- Platform shutdown or discontinuation
- Regulatory action or prohibition
- Loss of private keys
- Market collapse or loss of confidence
- Technical failures
- Competition from superior projects

---

## 3. Smart Contract Risks

### 3.1 Experimental Technology

Smart contracts are **experimental technology**. Despite security audits, code reviews, and testing, vulnerabilities may exist that could result in:

- **Permanent loss of funds**
- Theft of staked tokens
- Inability to withdraw or claim rewards
- Unexpected contract behavior
- Irreversible transactions

### 3.2 Code Vulnerabilities

Potential risks include:

- **Bugs and Exploits:** Programming errors that allow attackers to drain funds
- **Reentrancy Attacks:** Malicious contracts that manipulate transaction flow
- **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** Mathematical errors causing incorrect calculations
- **Access Control Issues:** Unauthorized parties gaining privileged access
- **Logic Errors:** Flaws in business logic causing unintended outcomes

### 3.3 Immutability

Once deployed, smart contracts are generally **immutable** (cannot be changed). While we may use upgradeable contract patterns:

- Upgrades may not be possible or may be restricted
- Bugs in deployed contracts may be permanent
- Historical transactions cannot be reversed
- Fixing issues may require migrating to new contracts

### 3.4 Audit Limitations

Even when smart contracts are audited:

- Audits are not guarantees of security
- Auditors may miss vulnerabilities
- Audits are point-in-time assessments
- New vulnerabilities may be discovered after audit
- Upgrades or changes may introduce new risks

### 3.5 Oracle and External Dependencies

If contracts rely on external data sources (oracles) or other contracts:

- Oracle manipulation could affect outcomes
- External contract failures could impact our contracts
- Data feeds may be inaccurate or unavailable
- Third-party dependencies may introduce vulnerabilities

### 3.6 User Error

**Blockchain transactions are irreversible.** User errors include:

- Sending tokens to the wrong address
- Approving malicious contracts
- Setting incorrect transaction parameters
- Losing private keys or seed phrases
- Falling victim to phishing attacks

**We cannot reverse transactions or recover lost funds due to user error.**

---

## 4. Staking Risks

### 4.1 Lock-Up Periods

Certain staking tiers require **locking your tokens for specified periods** (7 to 90 days). During lock-up:

- **You cannot access, withdraw, or transfer your tokens**
- You cannot sell tokens to avoid market losses
- Your tokens are subject to smart contract risk for the entire period
- Early withdrawal may not be possible or may incur penalties
- Emergency situations will not allow early access

### 4.2 Reward Rate Changes

Staking reward rates are **not guaranteed** and may change due to:

- Changes in total staked amounts (dilution)
- Protocol parameter adjustments
- Governance decisions
- Tokenomics modifications
- Platform sustainability considerations

Rewards may be:

- Reduced or eliminated at any time
- Changed without advance notice
- Affected by maximum supply caps
- Subject to vesting or lock periods

### 4.3 Market Risk During Staking

While your tokens are staked and locked:

- **The market value of GREP may decrease significantly**
- You cannot exit your position to prevent losses
- Opportunity cost of locked funds
- Rewards earned may not compensate for value loss

### 4.4 Slashing Risk

While our current staking contracts do not implement slashing (penalty for misbehavior):

- Future updates may introduce slashing mechanisms
- Related protocols or Layer 2 networks may implement slashing
- Validator misbehavior (if applicable) could result in losses
- Protocol violations could trigger penalties

### 4.5 Technical Risks

Staking operations may be affected by:

- **Network Congestion:** High gas fees or failed transactions
- **Smart Contract Bugs:** Errors in staking logic
- **Blockchain Reorganizations:** Chain forks or consensus issues
- **RPC Provider Failures:** Inability to interact with contracts
- **Frontend Issues:** Website or interface problems

### 4.6 No Guaranteed Returns

Staking does **not** guarantee returns. You may:

- Earn less than expected
- Lose value due to token depreciation
- Experience opportunity cost vs. other investments
- Face taxes on earned rewards
- Incur gas fees that exceed rewards
