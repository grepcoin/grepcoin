- ❌ A claim to company profits, dividends, or revenue
- ❌ Legal tender or a replacement for fiat currency

## 2. Utility Token Status

### 2.1 Functional Utility Only

GREP is designed and intended solely as a **functional utility token** with the following use cases:

1. **Gaming Rewards:** Earned through gameplay performance
2. **Staking:** Locked to increase reward multipliers
3. **Platform Access:** Required for certain features and benefits
4. **Governance:** Potential voting rights on platform decisions (future)
5. **Ecosystem Participation:** Accessing games, tournaments, and events

### 2.2 No Investment Purpose

GREP is **not designed, marketed, or intended for investment purposes.**

- Do not acquire GREP with any expectation of profit
- Do not acquire GREP as a speculative investment
- Do not acquire GREP expecting price appreciation
- Do not acquire GREP expecting passive income
- Do not rely on the efforts of GrepLabs LLC or others to generate profit

### 2.3 User Intent Matters

Even though GREP is designed as a utility token, **your intentions matter** from a legal and regulatory perspective:

- If you acquire GREP with investment expectations, you may be exposed to securities law risks
- If you acquire GREP solely for utility purposes, it aligns with our intended design
- Your treatment of GREP may affect how regulators view the token

**We strongly discourage treating GREP as an investment.**

## 3. Not a Security

### 3.1 Design as Utility Token

GrepLabs LLC has designed GREP to function as a utility token, not a security. The token is structured to avoid the characteristics of a security under applicable laws:

**Howey Test Analysis (U.S.):**
1. **Investment of Money:** While users may acquire GREP, the primary distribution is through earned gameplay rewards
2. **Common Enterprise:** GREP is designed for individual use within the platform, not pooled investment
3. **Expectation of Profits:** GREP is not marketed or intended to generate profits for holders
4. **Efforts of Others:** Token utility is derived from user actions (gameplay), not the efforts of GrepLabs LLC

### 3.2 No Securities Law Protections

Because GREP is structured as a utility token, not a security:

- It is **not registered** with the SEC or any securities regulator
- It does **not** provide securities law investor protections
- It is **not** subject to securities law disclosure requirements
- Holders do **not** have rights typically associated with security holders

### 3.3 Regulatory Uncertainty

Despite our design intent:

- Regulatory authorities may have different interpretations
- The legal classification of tokens continues to evolve
- Different jurisdictions may classify GREP differently
- Future regulations may affect GREP's classification

**We make no guarantees about how GREP will be classified by regulators.**

### 3.4 If GREP Were Deemed a Security

If any regulatory authority were to determine that GREP is a security:

- Distribution and trading may be restricted or prohibited
- Additional compliance obligations may arise
- Unregistered sales may be deemed violations
- Penalties and enforcement actions may occur
- The token may need to be restructured or discontinued

**You acknowledge and accept this risk.**

---

## 4. No Profit Expectations

### 4.1 No Returns Promised

GrepLabs LLC makes **NO** promises, guarantees, or representations regarding:

- Future token value or price appreciation
- Profits or financial returns of any kind
- Dividends, distributions, or revenue sharing

### 4.2 No Company Performance Link

GREP token value (if any) is **not** linked to:

- GrepLabs LLC's financial performance
- Platform revenue or profitability
- User growth or platform adoption
- Success of the GrepCoin project
- Efforts of the development team

Any correlation between these factors and token value is incidental, not designed or intended.

### 4.3 Value May Decrease or Become Zero

The market value of GREP (if any market exists) may:

- Fluctuate dramatically without warning
- Decrease significantly or to zero
- Never develop or remain at zero
