## 1. Introduction

GrepCoin represents a new paradigm in blockchain gaming: accessible, fun, and rewarding. Unlike complex play-to-earn games that require significant upfront investment or grinding, GrepCoin offers instant gratification through browser-based arcade games that anyone can play and enjoy.

### Key Highlights

- **8 Developer-Themed Games**: From regex puzzles to Git merge conflicts
- **Play-to-Earn**: Earn real cryptocurrency for playing
- **Staking Rewards**: Up to 20% APY on staked tokens
- **NFT Achievements**: Collect soulbound badges for milestones
- **Community Governance**: Vote on platform decisions
- **Built with AI**: Entire platform developed through human-AI collaboration

---

## 2. Vision

**GrepCoin is for the indie devs, the hobbyists, the dreamers who code after hours.**

We envision a gaming platform that:

1. **Celebrates Developer Culture**: Games themed around programming, debugging, and software development
2. **Rewards Players Fairly**: No pay-to-win mechanics, pure skill-based rewards
3. **Builds Community**: Guilds, tournaments, and social features
4. **Remains Open Source**: Transparent, community-driven development
5. **Demonstrates AI Potential**: Proof that AI can amplify human creativity

### Mission Statement

To create a sustainable, community-owned gaming ecosystem where players are rewarded for their time, skill, and engagement.

## 3. The Problem

### Current Play-to-Earn Challenges

1. **High Barriers to Entry**: Many P2E games require expensive NFT purchases ($100-$1000+)
2. **Unsustainable Economics**: Ponzi-like tokenomics that collapse when new player influx stops
3. **Poor Gameplay**: Games prioritize earning over fun
4. **Complex Onboarding**: Difficult for non-crypto users to start
5. **Centralization**: Game economies controlled by developers or whales

### Web2 Gaming Issues

1. **No Asset Ownership**: Players don't own their achievements or items
2. **Walled Gardens**: Can't transfer progress between games
3. **Developer Lock-in**: No say in game direction
4. **Time Not Valued**: Thousands of hours with zero monetary value

---

## 4. The Solution

GrepCoin addresses these issues through:

### 4.1 Accessible Gameplay

- **Categorized Allocations**: Separate pools for staking, gameplay, airdrops
- **Burn Mechanisms**: Deflationary pressure through voluntary burns
- **Long-term Vesting**: Team tokens locked for 3 years

### 4.3 Fun-First Design

- **Engaging Games**: Developer-themed arcade games
- **Progression Systems**: Achievements, quests, battle passes
- **Social Features**: Guilds, tournaments, leaderboards
- **Regular Updates**: New games and features quarterly

### 4.4 True Ownership

## 6. Staking System

### 6.1 Staking Tiers

GrepCoin offers 5 staking tiers with increasing rewards:

| Tier | Minimum | Lock Period | APY | Game Multiplier | Bonus Plays |
|------|---------|-------------|-----|-----------------|-------------|
| Flexible | 100 GREP | None | 5% | 1.1x | +2 daily |
| Bronze | 1,000 GREP | 7 days | 8% | 1.25x | +5 daily |
| Silver | 5,000 GREP | 14 days | 12% | 1.5x | +10 daily |
| Gold | 10,000 GREP | 30 days | 15% | 1.75x | +15 daily |
| Diamond | 50,000 GREP | 90 days | 20% | 2.0x | +25 daily |

### 6.2 Benefits of Staking

1. **Passive Income**: Earn APY on staked tokens
2. **Increased Rewards**: Higher multipliers on gameplay earnings
3. **More Plays**: Additional daily game plays
4. **Governance Power**: Staked tokens count for voting
5. **Early Access**: Beta features for high-tier stakers
6. **Exclusive NFTs**: Special items for Diamond tier

### 6.3 Reward Calculation

Staking rewards are calculated continuously and can be claimed anytime:

```
Rewards = (Staked Amount × APY × Time Staked) / (365 days)
```

**Example:**
- Staked: 10,000 GREP (Gold tier)
- APY: 15%
- Time: 30 days
- Rewards: 10,000 × 0.15 × (30/365) = 123.29 GREP

### 6.4 Lock Periods

- Tokens are locked for the minimum period of the tier
- After lock expires, can unstake or continue earning
- Early unstaking not permitted (prevents gaming the system)
- Can add to existing stake (extends lock period)

### 6.5 Sustainability

Staking rewards come from the 300M staking allocation:
- Average staking rate: 40% of supply
- Average lock period: 30 days
- Effective APY: ~12%
- Staking pool lasts: ~6-7 years at full capacity
