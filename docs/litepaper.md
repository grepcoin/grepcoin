# GrepCoin Lite Paper

**Version 1.1 | December 2024**

---

## Executive Summary

GrepCoin (GREP) is a deflationary ERC-20 token powering an AI-built play-to-earn crypto arcade on Base L2. Players earn GREP by playing browser games, stake tokens for real yield, and collect achievement NFTs.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Fixed Supply**: 500M tokens, no inflation
- **Real Yield**: Staking rewards from platform revenue, not minting
- **Deflationary**: Multiple burn mechanisms reduce supply over time
- **Low Fees**: Base L2 enables sub-cent transactions
- **AI-Built**: Developed transparently with Claude AI

## The Problem

Traditional gaming platforms extract value:
- 30% revenue share (Steam, Apple, Google)
- No ownership of in-game achievements
- Fragmented economies across games
- No real earning potential for players

Web3 gaming often fails due to:
- Inflationary tokenomics (death spiral)
- High gas fees limiting micro-transactions
- Complex onboarding
- Poor game quality

---

## The Solution

GrepCoin addresses these issues through:

### 1. Sustainable Tokenomics
```
Fixed Supply: 500,000,000 GREP
├── 40% Ecosystem & Rewards
├── 20% Liquidity Pool
├── 15% Team (4-year vest)
├── 15% Treasury
└── 10% Early Supporters
```

No new tokens are ever minted. All rewards come from:
- Platform revenue distribution
- Treasury allocations
- Initial token distribution

### 2. Real Yield Staking

| Tier | Min Stake | Lock | Reward Weight | Benefits |
|------|-----------|------|---------------|----------|
| Basic | 100 GREP | None | 1.0x | Vote on evolutions |
| Silver | 1,000 GREP | 7 days | 1.25x | Early access |
| Gold | 5,000 GREP | 30 days | 1.5x | Propose features |
| Diamond | 25,000 GREP | 90 days | 2.0x | Revenue share |

Rewards are funded by platform revenue, not inflation.

### 3. Deflationary Burns

| Source | Burn Rate |
|--------|-----------|
| Marketplace fees | 2.5% |
| Tournament entries | 10% |
| Achievement NFT mints | 10 GREP |
| Guild creation | 500 GREP |

Target: Reduce circulating supply by 20% over 5 years.

### 4. Base L2 Benefits
- **Fast**: 2-second block times
- **Cheap**: Sub-cent transaction fees
- **Secure**: Ethereum L1 security
- **Growing**: Coinbase ecosystem
