# GrepCoin AI Evolution Economy

**Version 2.0 - The Deflationary Gaming Model**

---

## Executive Summary

GrepCoin introduces the **AI Evolution Economy** - a novel tokenomic model where platform growth directly drives token scarcity. Every AI-generated game, level, and piece of content burns GREP tokens, creating a deflationary spiral tied to ecosystem success.

**Core Principle:** *The more the platform evolves, the scarcer GREP becomes.*

## The Problem with Traditional P2E

| Issue | Traditional P2E | GrepCoin Solution |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Infinite emissions | Tokens minted forever for rewards | Fixed supply, burns exceed emissions |
| Value dilution | More tokens = less value per token | Fewer tokens over time = more value |
| Unsustainable APY | 20-100% APY drains treasury | 3-8% APY from real revenue |
| No real utility | Token only for speculation | Token required for core features |
| Death spiral | New players stop → economy collapses | Burns continue regardless of growth |

---

## Token Specifications (Revised)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Token Name | GrepCoin |
| Symbol | GREP |
| Total Supply | 500,000,000 (500M) - Fixed, no minting |
| Network | Base L2 |
| Type | Deflationary Utility Token |

### Initial Distribution

| Allocation | Amount | % | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---|---------|
| Ecosystem & Rewards | 200M | 40% | Gameplay, staking, grants |
| Liquidity | 100M | 20% | DEX pools, market making |
| Team | 75M | 15% | 4-year vest, 1-year cliff |
| Treasury | 75M | 15% | Operations, partnerships |
| Early Supporters | 50M | 10% | Seed investors, advisors |

## The Burn Economy

### Tier 1: AI Evolution Burns (High Impact)

These burns occur when AI generates new content:

| Action | Burn Amount | Frequency | Annual Burn Est. |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| New game generation | 50,000 GREP | 4/year | 200,000 |
| Seasonal content pack | 25,000 GREP | 4/year | 100,000 |
| Weekly challenge set | 5,000 GREP | 52/year | 260,000 |
| Community-voted evolution | 10,000 GREP | 12/year | 120,000 |
| **Tier 1 Total** | | | **680,000/year** |

### Tier 2: Player Activity Burns (Medium Impact)

| Action | Burn Amount | Est. Daily | Annual Burn Est. |
|--------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| Tournament entry (10%) | ~50 GREP avg | 500 entries | 9,125,000 |
| Marketplace sale (2.5%) | ~25 GREP avg | 200 sales | 1,825,000 |
| Achievement mint | 10 GREP | 100 mints | 365,000 |
| Custom challenge request | 100 GREP | 20 requests | 730,000 |
| **Tier 2 Total** | | | **12,045,000/year** |

### Tier 3: Governance Burns (Variable)

| Action | Burn Amount | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Proposal submission | 1,000 GREP | Refunded if passes |
| Failed proposal | 1,000 GREP | Burned |
| Evolution vote | Voted amount | All votes burned |
| Guild creation | 500 GREP | One-time |

### Burn Targets

| Year | Target Burn Rate | Circulating After |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 3% (15M) | ~200M |
| 2 | 5% (10M) | ~190M |
| 3 | 5% (9.5M) | ~180M |
| 5 | 5% (8.5M) | ~160M |
| 10 | 5% (6M) | ~120M |

**Long-term target:** Reduce circulating supply to 100M (80% burned)

## AI Evolution Mechanics

### 1. Weekly Evolution Auctions

Every week, the community decides what AI builds next:

```
Monday:    Proposal submissions open (100 GREP to propose)
Wednesday: Voting begins (vote with GREP, all votes burned)
Friday:    Voting ends, winner announced
Weekend:   AI generates content
Monday:    New content released
```

**Voting Power:**
- 1 GREP = 1 vote
- All voted GREP is burned (not returned)
- Top 10 voters get early access (24 hours)
- Proposer of winning idea gets 10% of votes back

### 2. Evolution Categories

Players vote on:

| Category | Example | Burn Per Evolution |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| New Game | "Blockchain Tower Defense" | 50,000 GREP |
| Game Mode | "Endless mode for Stack Panic" | 10,000 GREP |
| Level Pack | "10 new regex patterns" | 5,000 GREP |
| Cosmetic Set | "Cyberpunk theme pack" | 2,500 GREP |
| Challenge Type | "Speedrun leaderboards" | 5,000 GREP |

### 3. Limited Editions

AI-generated content is unique and scarce:

- Each evolution has a **Generation ID**
- First players to complete new content get NFT badges
- Seasonal content expires after 90 days
- "Genesis" content (first year) marked specially

---

## Utility-Driven Demand

### Must-Have Uses (Creates Buy Pressure)

| Use Case | GREP Required | Frequency |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Tournament entry | 50-500 GREP | Weekly tournaments |
| Premium game access | 100 GREP/month | Ongoing |
| Guild membership | Stake 1,000 GREP | Continuous |
| Evolution voting | Any amount | Weekly |
| Marketplace purchases | Variable | Daily |
| Battle pass | 500 GREP/season | Quarterly |

### Nice-to-Have Uses

| Use Case | GREP Required |
|----------|---------------|
| Custom username | 100 GREP (burned) |
| Profile cosmetics | 50-500 GREP |
| Emotes and reactions | 25-100 GREP |
| Guild upgrades | 500-5,000 GREP |

## Staking 2.0: Real Yield Model

### Old Model (Unsustainable)
- APY from token emissions
- Creates inflation
- Eventually runs out

### New Model (Sustainable)

**Staking rewards come from platform revenue, not emissions.**

Revenue Sources:
- Marketplace fees (2.5%)
- Tournament fees (10%)
- Premium subscriptions
- Partnership revenue

| Tier | Stake Required | Lock | APY (from revenue) | Perks |
|------|----------------|------|-------------------|-------|
| Basic | 100 GREP | None | 3% | Vote on evolutions |
| Silver | 1,000 GREP | 7 days | 5% | Early access to content |
| Gold | 5,000 GREP | 30 days | 6% | Propose evolutions |
| Diamond | 25,000 GREP | 90 days | 8% | Revenue share + governance |

**APY Calculation:**
```
Weekly Revenue Pool = Platform Revenue × 50%
Your Share = (Your Stake / Total Staked) × Weekly Pool
APY = (Your Share × 52) / Your Stake
```

*APY fluctuates based on revenue and total staked.*

| Burns too aggressive | Governance can adjust rates |
| Revenue too low for staking | Minimum APY from treasury reserves |
| Low voting participation | Incentivize with exclusive rewards |
| AI content quality | Human review before release |
| Token price volatility | Diversified treasury, POL |

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Tokens Burned | 15M (3%) | 35M (7%) | 75M (15%) |
| Circulating Supply | ~200M | ~165M | ~125M |
| Active Stakers | 5,000 | 25,000 | 100,000 |
| Weekly Evolution Votes | 100K GREP | 500K GREP | 2M GREP |
| Platform Revenue | $50K/mo | $250K/mo | $1M/mo |

## Summary

The AI Evolution Economy transforms GrepCoin from a generic P2E token into a **deflationary utility asset** where:

1. **Supply decreases** as the platform grows
2. **AI evolution** creates unique, scarce content
3. **Community voting** drives engagement and burns
4. **Real revenue** funds sustainable rewards
5. **Token value** appreciates through scarcity

**This is not just play-to-earn. This is own-to-participate.**
